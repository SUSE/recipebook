Contributed by: Alex

Nuremberg is very famous for its Elisen Lebkuchen and many tourists from all
over the world come to visit the city during Christmas time and see the
"Christkindlesmarkt" and taste some of those specialties. A very important
rule for those Elisen Lebkuchen is that they must not contain flour. This is
my version of Nuremberg's specialty.

Ingredients:

| 6 oz   | 180 g  | Sugar (brown)           | Zucker (braun)
| 2 Tbsp | 2 EL   | Honey                   | Honig
| 2 tsp  | 2 TL   | Cinnamon                | Zimt
| 2 tsp  | 2 TL   | Gingerbread spice       | Lebkuchengewürz
| 1 pch  | 1 Prise| Salt                    | Salz
| 7 oz   | 200 g  | Almonds (ground)        | Mandeln (gemahlen)
| 3.5 oz | 100 g  | Almonds (chopped)       | Mandeln (gehackt)
| 7 oz   | 200 g  | Hazelnuts (ground)      | Haselnüsse (gemahlen)
| 7 oz   | 200 g  | Candied orange peel     | Orangeat (finely chopped)
| 7 oz   | 200 g  | Cendied lemon peel      | Zitronat (finely chopped)
| 30/40  | 30/40  | Round wavers (3" or 4") | Oblaten (70 mm oder 90 mm)
| 10.5 oz| 300 g  | Chocolate coating       | Kuvertüre
|=========================================================

==== Preparation:

1. Beat eggs, sugar, and honey until fluffy. Mix in the remaining ingredients.

2. Spread the dough flat onto the wavers. Results in about 30 pieces (4" / 90
mm) or 40 pieces (3" / 70 mm).  Put them on a baking tray with baking paper.

3. Bake at 150°C / 300°F (upper and lower heat) for about 20 - 30 minutes.
Bake shorter for softer/smaller lebkuchen.

4. Put the lebkuchen on a grid to cool down and avoid soaked through wavers.

5. Melt the chocolate coating (I usually use dark and milk chocolate
half/half) and brush the lebkuchen. You can decorate them with whole blanched
almonds.
