=== Mannavaht

This is a traditional Estonian dessert made from semolina and currants whisked
into a very fluffy foam.

Ingredients:

* 700 ml or 3 cups of water
* 300 ml or 1 1/4 cups of lingonberries or red currants
* 75 ml or 70 g or 5 tbsp of sugar (adjust to taste depending on the berries
  that you are using)
* 150 ml or 0.5 cups + 2 tbsp of semolina


Preparation:

. Bring the water to a boil, crushed berries and add them with the sugar to the
  boiling water.
. Whisk in the semolina and let simmer for about 15 minutes. Mix during
  the process to avoid the semolina & berries to burn.
. Pour the semolina into a large bowl and whisk with mixer until fluffy and
  cooled off a bit. This can take 10 to 15 minutes.
. Let it cool off completely in the fridge. Optionally, serve with milk.
