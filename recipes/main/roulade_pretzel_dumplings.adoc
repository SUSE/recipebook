=== Roulades with Pretzel Dumplings

Contributed by: Alex

Although roulades are well-known in most areas of Germany and surrounding
countries this version is based on a family recipe which I've "improved" over
time. Pretzel dumplings are a typical Bavarian side dish which harmonize
perfectly with the roulades.

==== Ingredients for the Roulades

==== Preparing the Roulades

1. Cook the eggs (about 7 min, not too hard), peel and cut into small pieces. Cut
one of the carrots and the gherkins in stripes (so they'll fit into the
roulade). Take the spinach out of the freezer to defrost.

2. Dice 2 of the onions and roast them with some oil in a pan. Chop the
parsley and add it to the onions.

3. Flatten the roulades with a meat mallet (best to cover the meat with
plastic wrap to avoid bruising it).

4. Salt and pepper the roulades and spread mustard on each piece.

5. Portion the roasted onions and eggs onto the roulades.

6. Put 2-3 slices of bacon on each roulade.

7. Distribute the spinach equally on the roulades.

8. Distribute the carrot and gherkin stripes on the roulades.

9. Roll up the roulades and fix them with small skewers or toothpicks.

10. Sear the roulades with butter oil from all sides in a roasting tray.

11. Meanwhile chop the remaining carrots and onions into bigger pieces and
brown them with the roulades for a bit.

12. Pour the water with beef broth (and optionally wine) into the roasting
tray. Close the lid and cook for 1.5 - 2 hours either on the stove or in the
oven.

13. Remove the lid during the last 15 min so the liquid can start reducing.

14. Remove the roulades once they are cooked and let them rest aside. Remove
the skewers/toothpicks.

15. Remove the vegetables with a slotted spoon. You can also keep (some) of
them and blend it but that way the sauce will get thicker.

16. Further reduce the remaining sauce and add tomato paste and cream as
preferred. Optionally create a roux and add it to thicken the sauce.

17. Add again the roulades when you're satisfied with the sauce. Keep warm
until the dumplings are ready.

==== Preparating the Dumplings

image::roulades_pretzel_dumplings/preparing_dumplings.jpg[Dumpling preparation, 640, 480]

1. Cut the pretzels (or buns) in litte pieces. 

2. Heat the milk and pour over the pretzels. 

3. Mix in the eggs and parsley, season with salt and pepper.

4. Dice and roast the onions and add them to the dough.

5. Let the dough rest for about 30 min. Stir it after half of the time.

6. Form 6-8 dumplings and simmer them for about 25 min in saltwater.

7. Remove the dumplings and serve them hot.

Variant:

Form a sausage and wrap it in plastic wrap. Tightly seal the ends (with knots
if possible). Simmer in boiling saltwater for about 25 min. Cut in slices.

Cold slices can also be roasted with butter in a pan, fits perfectly nearly
every roast.

==== Eat it

Either way, serve the roulades with dumplings and pour some sauce over it.

Bon appetit!
