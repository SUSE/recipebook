This recipe will result in about 2-3 portions of tofu. You require a cheese cloth and either a tofu press for tofu preparation or a cheese press.

Depending on the coagulant, temperature, stirring and weight and time on the tofu press you can get either silken tofu or different stages of firm tofu.

Preparation:

. Heat the soy milk to 75-80 degrees Celsius. The hotter the liquid the more solid the resulting tofu.
. Prepare the Nigari following the instructions on the packaging. Alternatively prepare the Nigari replacement (instructions to follow, once I figured out a good mixture).
. Stir the hot soy milk with a wooden spoon to create a vortex. Add the coagulant and stop the vortex with the spoon. More vigorous stirring will result in a firmer tofu. The liquid should start to separate shortly after adding the coagulant.
. Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes.
. Prepare the tofu press by putting the cheese cloth in it and putting the press either in the sink or a large pot. Separate the curds from the liquid with a ladle and put them in the press. If you want, you can collect the remaining liquid and use it like whey.
. Put the lid on the press and add weight to it. Let the press do its job. I had my best results with 2kg for about 15 minutes, which yields a spongy tofu (see picture).
. Store the tofu in brine and consume within 2-3 days. I usually use a container that fits the tofu without many gaps and fill it up with a brine consisting of at least 2 tsp of salt. You can also use soy milk in the brine for a brown colouring and additional flavour.
