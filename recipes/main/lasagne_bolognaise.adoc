Lasagne Bolognaise. My way, the Bolognaise made with some additional vegetables and a lot of Béchamel. Prep time is 1.5 hours but you'll have free time while it's in the oven. 

You'll need (depending on the size your baking dish):

(for the Bolognaise)

* 700g minced meet (pork, beef, or mixed)
* 800g chopped Tomatoes (2 small cans)
* tomato paste
* 2 onions
* small piece of celery
* 2 carrots
* 1 leek
* 4 garlic cloves
* Ketchup
* basil
* oregano
* thyme
* Tabasco
* vegetable or meat broth
* Salt
* Olive oil

(for the Béchamel)

* 800ml Milk
* 60g Butter
* 3 heaped Tablespoons wheat flour
* nutmeg
* white pepper
* Salt

(and)

* Lasagne noodles (without pre-cooking)
* 250g grounded Cheese to gratinate

Preparation:

(Bolognaise)

. Roast gently the minced meat with olive oil until the water is almost gone
. Chop the onions and add them, continue to roast. Add crushed garlic and some thyme
. Chop carrots and celery and add them, still roast until it starts stick to the bottom or is too browned. Reduce heat.
. Add chopped tomatoes, a dash of ketchup and Tabasco, season well with enough oregano and basil. Taste with broth and/or salt.
. Add tomato paste if runny, or along with water to add more volume
. Finally add leek cut into slices and let it gently boil 15 minutes

(Béchamel)

. Add butter to a pot, heat strongly until it melts and the water is gone
. Add the wheat flour and permanently stir with a whisk, never stop!
. If there's not enough butter to bind the flour add some more. Stir!
. Slowly add the cold milk until the flour sets, continue to add milk and continuously stir to not get it storched
. once all milk is in and all is set remove heat. The sauce should be pasty but way less than pudding. If it's still too gooey continue to add milk
. season with salt, pepper and a bit of nutmeg

(bring them together)

. Fill a form, start with the Béchamel to cover the ground
. Lay lasagne noodles with some overlap, to cover all the surface. Cut them to fit if the overlay is too big
. Continue with Bolognaise and Béchamel until you're out of sauces. The top layer should be Béchamel
. add the grounded cheese and put it in the pre-heated oven at 170°C in the center.
