Lasagne Bolognaise. My way, the Bolognaise made with some additional vegetables and a lot of Béchamel. Prep time is 1.5 hours but you'll have free time (to clean up the kitchen :-) while it's in the oven. 

Quanitites are for 5-6 servings, you'll need (depending on the size your baking dish):

Preparation:

(Bolognaise)

. Roast gently the minced meat with olive oil until the water is almost gone.
. Chop the onions and add them, continue to roast. Add crushed garlic and some thyme.
. Chop carrots and celery and add them, still roast until it starts stick to the bottom or is too browned. Reduce heat.
. Add chopped tomatoes, a dash of ketchup and Tabasco, season well with enough oregano and basil. Taste with broth and/or salt.
. Add tomato paste if runny, or along with water to add more volume.
. Finally add leek cut into slices and let it gently boil 15 minutes.

(Béchamel)

. Add butter to a pot, heat strongly until it melts and the water is gone.
. Add the wheat flour and permanently stir with a whisk, never stop!.
. If there's not enough butter to bind the flour add some more. Stir!
. Slowly add the cold milk until the flour sets, continue to add milk and continuously stir to not get it storched.
. Once all milk is in and all is set remove heat. The sauce should be pasty but way less than pudding. If it's still too gooey continue to add milk.
. Season with salt, pepper and a bit of nutmeg.

(bring them together)

. Fill a rectangle form, start with the Béchamel to cover the ground.
. Lay lasagne noodles with some overlap, to cover all the surface. Cut them with a sharp knife to fit if the overlay is too big.
. Continue with Bolognaise to cover the noodles, then some Béchamel until you're out of sauces. The top layer should be Béchamel.
. Add the grounded cheese and put it in the pre-heated oven at 170°C/340F, in the center.
