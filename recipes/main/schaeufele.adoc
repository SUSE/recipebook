=== Frankonian Schaeufele

Contributed by: Alex

Schaeufele is a very typical Frankonian dish which in my opinion every meat
lover should have enjoyed at least once in life. The name schaeufele refers to
the pan of a shovel and comes from the shape of the bone (pork shoulder).

|=========================================================

==== Preparation

1. Cut the rind diagonally (the smaller the pieces the crunchier, watch out to
not cut into the meat below) or let the butcher do it.

2. Wash the meat and pat it dry. Thoroughly rub it with salt, pepper and
caraway. Do not put caraway on the rind (else it'll get chewy).

3. Preheat the oven to 160°C / 320°F (top/bottom heat).

4. Melt the resolidified butter in a roasting tray and sear the schaeufeles
from all sides. Again, spare the rind. 

5. Quarter the onions, half the garlic cloves, chop the carrots, leek, and
celery into coarse pieces and add them. Also add the parsley twigs. Make sure
the rind is up.

6. Pour the broth into the roasting tray so that all vegetables are covered
(but the rind is not). Close the lid of the roasting tray and put the roast on
the lower rack of the oven for 4 hours. During the last 30 minutes gently
pour the beer over the rind about every 10 minutes.

7. Remove the lid, switch to circulating air and increase the temperature to
everything it got - 250°C/480°F to get a crispy crust. Watch it all the time
as the rind pieces will pop quite quickly and you don't want to burn it now!

8. When you're satisfied with the crackling take the roasting tray out of the
oven, switch off the oven, and leave the oven door open for a moment. Put the
schaeufles on a plate and let them rest in the still warm oven. 

9. Puree (some of) the vegetables in the gravy. You could also eat some or all
of the vegetables as starter (my wife and daughter love them). The amount of
pureed vegetables influences the thickness (and also the taste) of the sauce.
In any case, sieve the sauce into a pot and possibly salt and pepper to taste.
Briefly boil up the sauce.

10. Serve the schaeufele with sauce but pay attention to not pour sauce over
the crackling.

===== Side dishes: 
Potato dumplings, sauerkraut, savoy cabbage and/or mixed salad. A good dark
beer completes this delicious dish!


Bon appetit!
