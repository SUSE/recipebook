=== Creamy Chicken and Leek Pie
image::chicken-leek-pie/chicken-leek-pie.jpeg[Chicken and Leek Pie Filling, 270, 230]

I took this lovely recipe from the BBC, but adjusted it slightly for taste
and ease. It's become a complete favourite in our house! It's so easy, with
simple ingredients. Next time, I think I would like to try adding more
vegetables for more flavour.


Enjoy with a lovely white wine - as modelled by me.

Pie Ingredients::

* 50g butter
* 1 leek, finely sliced
* 8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into chunks
* 1 thyme sprig, leaves picked
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 tbsp plain flour
* 100ml white wine or dry sherry
* 300ml chicken stock
* 100ml crème fraîche (sour cream) or double cream
* 1 tbsp mustard (I recommend wholegrain, but any mustard works)
* 2 tsp of smoked paprika

Pastry Ingredients::

NOTE: I, personally, would just buy puff pastry. I'd recommend at least 2 sheets
of pastry if you'd like to line the tin, or one is just fine if you prefer your
pie without a bottom. However, if you're feeling adventurous...

* 150g cold butter, cut into cubes, plus extra for the dish
* 400g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting
* 1 egg, beaten

Method::

1. Melt the butter in a casserole dish over a low heat (If you do not have a
   casserole dish that can be used on the hob and in the oven, use a large pan).
2. Add the leek, chicken, herbs and seasoning, and cook for 10-12 mins until
   the chicken is cooked, the leeks have softened, and the mixture is simmering.
3. Stir in the flour and cook for 3 mins until the mix resembles a sandy paste.
4. Pour in the wine or sherry, and bubble for 1 min, then stir in the stock,
   crème fraîche or cream and the mustard.
5. Bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 mins until the chicken is cooked through.
6. Season to taste with smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Remove from the heat and
   leave to cool completely.
7. Chill for 2 hrs, or overnight.

If you are making the pastry...

1. Rub the butter into the flour with a large pinch of salt until completely
   combined.
2. Add half the beaten egg and 4 tbsp ice-cold water, and bring together into
   a dough using your hands, adding a little more water if needed.
3. Knead for a minute so it completely comes together, then chill for 1 hr.

Back to the pie...

1. Butter a 20cm loose-bottomed cake tin. Roll two-thirds of the pastry out
   until large enough to line the tin with some overhanging.
2. Use it to line the tin, then spoon in the filling. Roll out the remaining
   pastry until large enough to cover the pie.
3. Brush the edge of the pastry with a little of the remaining beaten egg,
   then drape over the pie to close it.
4. Trim the edge, then press with a fork to seal. Chill until you’re ready to
   cook. Will keep chilled for up to 24 hrs.

Cooking::

1. Heat the oven to 220C/200C (400F) fan/gas 7 with a baking sheet inside. Brush the
   pie with some of the remaining beaten egg, then lightly score a criss-cross
   pattern on top using a sharp knife.
2. Bake on the hot sheet for 20 mins, then brush with the rest of the egg,
   season with sea salt flakes and bake for 15-20 mins more until deep golden.
3. Remove from the oven and rest for 10 mins, then carefully remove from the
   tin, put on a board and cut into wedges to serve.
