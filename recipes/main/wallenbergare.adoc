Wallenbergare got very popular in Sweden in the 1930s and named after Amalia Wallenberg who was the wife of Marcus Wallenberg.

Wallenberg is the largest and most famous finance families in Sweden and owns the majority of Ericsson, NASDAQ, SAAB just to mention a few.

That family is the majority owner of EQT, so in a way they were owning SUSE for a while :) 
Anyhow, Wallenbergare is a mild veal patty, mashed potatoes, peas, lingonberries and skimmed butter.
It's not the most healthy dish, so you can't have it every day

Preparation:

. Keep all ingredients for the Wallenbergare really cold, if they are not very cold they could separate and you wouldn't be able to form patties.
Put minced veal in a bowl (also chilled) with the egg yolks and the spices and mix it with an electric mixer. Carefully add the cream, in a fine stream while the mixer is still running. Keep mixing until all cream is added, but don't over mix it, it might get to warm and separate if you do.
. Put half of the breadcrumbs on a plate, dip your hands in cold water and form for patties of the loose minced veal mixture. Sprinkle the remaining breadcrumbs over the patties. Let them rest for a couple of minutes (until you warm up the frying pan)
. Fry the patties in butter on low to medium heat until you have a light golden color, they might need to finish of in the oven. The patties should be fluffy and "light".

Served with mash potatoes, Sweetened lingonberries, peas and skimmed butter.
Enjoy!
